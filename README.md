# Welcome!

Are you curious about what's the picture for?

<img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20188476/154903099-0025fe65-e04e-44b7-aea2-d1fc0f8323bc.png width=60% />

This amazing picture is from the UMAP projection of the 21-nt sequences of **999,240** human A-to-I RNA editing sites (non-Alu repeats) in REDIportal! Each pixel here represents a set of similar sequences, and brightness of the pixels represent the density of sites. With this picture, we can intuitively learn what kinds of k-mers (21-mers here) are included and enriched in such huge amount of RNA editing events. This is never been done before.

## Introduction

**interactive epitranscriptomic Motif Visualization and Sub-type Partitioning (iMVP)** is a strategy inspired by the commonly used single cell analysis strategy of dimensional reduction followed by clustering. Different from the digital counts in single cell analysis, we here use the RNA sequence (and/or structure) as an input. Here, we firstly transform RNA sequences into a one-hot format; then these transformed sequences were projected to a 2D plane with UMAP, which can not only gather the similar sequences together, but also maintain the relationships between each other (compared with t-SNE); the dimensional reduced data were further clustered by density, with the super-efficient algorithm HDBSCAN, to highlight the enriched sequences.

Compared with canonical motif discovery strategies, such as MEME (statistics driven), iMVP no longer relays on the given parameters of window lengths, p-value cutoff, and etc. It is more intuitive for motif finding and more sensitive for minor motifs, making the motif finding process transparent. More importantly, we are now able to analyze modification sites in a extremely huge number. For example, the largest dataset we analyzed is the human A-to-I editing records with >15,000,000 sites in >5,000,000 21-mers. We finished the analysis with a single RTX2080Ti GPU within 1 hour, which is impossible for any other motif finders.

## Best practices

iMVP is currently not a single package. We provide two ways to apply iMVP in your analysis:
- For new users not experienced in Python, we suggest you to use our interactive interface for quick analysis.
- For advanced users, we suggest you to follow our `Notebooks` (method-to-modifications):
  - `HeLa_Noc.ipynb` and `Human_dev.ipynb` are for the basics construction of an iMVP analysis (one-to-one).
  - `m6A_methods.ipynb` and `PseudoU_methods.ipynb` are for the comparative analysis of different methods for RNA modification discovery (one-to-several).
  - `RNA_seq_var.ipynb` is for modification discovery from RNA-seq variants (one-to-many).
  - `m6A_nanopore.ipynb` is for phase-matching stratey for Nanopore modification discovery (one-to-many). 
  - `Benchmarking_[xxx].ipynb` are Notebooks for method and parameter selection guidances. 
- More background knowledge for `UMAP` and `HDBSCAN` can be found here (https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and here (https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


## Requirements

We use `Python 3` in iMVP. We list the packages required in each notebook. In summary, we require `pandas`, `numpy`, `umap-learn`, `hdbscan`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for most of the usages. For some cases, `scikit-learn` should be isntalled for benchmarking. We recommend you to install `Weblogo` and `MEME` for further analysis of the clusters.

For `Linux` (and probably for `MacOS`), all of the packages and softwares are available on Pypi (with `pip`) or on the official websites:

`pip install iMVP-utils`

We don't recommend running iMVP with `Windows`. Please note that, `hdbscan` from Pypi is not compatible, instead, you can get an wheels (https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) with some troubles with multi-threads (please modify `core_n_jobs` if you get some troubles). In addition, `Weblogo` and `MEME` are not available on Windows, too. 


## GPU accerlation

To achieve analysis with huge dataset, we use NVIDIA `RAPIDS` library (majorly `cuML`) to accelerate `UMAP` and `HDBSCAN`. Please visit the office pages for more information.

Please note that, we can speed up `UMAP` with `RRAPIDS` in more than 40-folds. But it's hard for `HDBSCAN`, because we will have various computational complexity with different data and different parameters. I offen get out of GPU memory if too many small clusters are wating for analyzing. Hence, the current best practices for large dataset (e.g., 40 million non-repeative editing sites) is to use `UMAP` to compute the corrdinates on the 2D plane, then process the projections to CPU version `HDBSCAN` for further clustering. We also notice that, soft-clustering strategy will be buggy when the condensed tree is too large.
